Full Backup
- Takes a complete snapshot of the entire database, including all data and transaction logs.
- It’s the foundation for other backups.
- Example: BACKUP DATABASE MyDB TO DISK = 'C:\backup\MyDB_Full.bak'

Differential Backup 
- Backs up only the changes made since the last full backup (not the last differential).
- Smaller and faster than a full backup.
- Requires the last full backup for restore.
- Example: BACKUP DATABASE MyDB TO DISK = 'C:\backup\MyDB_Diff.bak' WITH DIFFERENTIAL

Transaction Log Backup 
- Captures all transactions since the last log backup.
- Helps in point-in-time recovery (useful for disaster recovery).
- Requires full recovery model enabled.
- Example: BACKUP LOG MyDB TO DISK = 'C:\backup\MyDB_Log.trn'

Shrink 
- means compress data base without losing data

```

BACKUP LOG [YourDatabase] 
TO DISK = 'D:\Backup\YourDatabase_Log.trn'
WITH INIT, COMPRESSION;

GO
SELECT file_id, name, physical_name, type_desc
FROM sys.database_files; -- here return a log file name and you should put it on below query 
GO

DBCC SHRINKFILE('YourDatabase_Log', 0); 

-- 0 : mean the maximum compress as you can while not losing data
